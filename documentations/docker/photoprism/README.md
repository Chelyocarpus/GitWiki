3. Paste/Save "docker-compose.yml" in the newly created directory "D:/Photoprism"

1. Edit the "docker-compose.yml" to your liking. Recommended changes:

* PHOTOPRISM\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD: "insecure" > PHOTOPRISM\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD: "YOURPASSWORD"
* PHOTOPRISM\_ORIGINALS\_LIMIT: 5000 > PHOTOPRISM\_ORIGINALS\_LIMIT: 50000
* PHOTOPRISM\_JPEG\_QUALITY: 85 > PHOTOPRISM\_JPEG\_QUALITY: 100

1. Open the folder with Windows Terminal

### Additional

* To add new/other folders for import/storage you'll have to add them to "volumes"

**Important:** Keep in mind that "photoprism/originals", "photoprism/storage" and "photoprism/import" are used as a variable, the pictures will be saved under "User/Pictures" **not** "User/Pictures/photoprism/originals"!

For additonal info about the folder structure see [Setup Using Docker Compose](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).

* You can use the "Import" function to import complete folders.
* To delete pictures you'll have to archieve them first.

### Image Folders on Windows

If you are using docker on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), you can access the images via hidden share:

`\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\overlay2`

The volums are also there at:

`\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\volumes`
