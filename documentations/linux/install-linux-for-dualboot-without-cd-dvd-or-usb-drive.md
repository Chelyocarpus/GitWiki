# ðŸ”§ Install Linux for Dualboot without CD/DVD or USB-Drive

When you don't want to burn a CD/DVD (or have an optical drive) or don't have a free USB-Stick on hand, this is the way.

### Prerequisites

There are as many Linux distributions as there are ice cream flavours, so get your favourite one.

If you don't know any or can't decide which one to take here's a small selection:

| Overview                                     | Download Page                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)         | [Download Page](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) |
| [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)        | [Download Page](https://pop.system76.com/)          |
| [Plasma](https://kde.org/de/plasma-desktop/) | [Download Page](https://kde.org/de/distributions/)  |
| [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)            | [Download Page](https://zorin.com/os/download/)     |

At this point you should be downloading a 1-3 GB big .iso file.

### &#x20;Disk partitioning

While the file is downloading we can use the time to create two disk partitions (=split the hard drive) so we don't overwrite Windows nor important files.

#### Creating a \~5 GB disk partition with the **fat32** file format
